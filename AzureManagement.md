Tip
You can tell you're in PowerShell mode by the PS before your directory on the command line.
```
Use the PowerShell Get-date command to get the current date and time.
```
Get-date
```
Most Azure specific commands will start with the letters az. The Get-date command you just ran is a PowerShell specific command. Let's try an Azure command to check what version of the CLI you're using right now.
```
az version
```
